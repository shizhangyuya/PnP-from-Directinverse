## üõ†Ô∏è Method Overview
<span id="method-overview"></span>

Text-guided diffusion models revolutionize image generation and editing, offering exceptional realism and diversity. Specifically, in the context of diffusion-based editing, common practice begins with a source image and a target prompt for editing. It involves obtaining a noisy latent vector corresponding to the source image using the diffusion model, which is then supplied to separate source and target diffusion branches for editing. The accuracy of this inversion process significantly impacts the final editing outcome, influencing both *essential content preservation* of the source image and *edit fidelity* according to the target prompt. 

Previous inversion techniques attempted to find a unified solution in both the source and target diffusion branches. However, theoretical and empirical analysis shows that, in fact, a disentangling of the two branches leads to a clear separation of the responsibility for essential content preservation and edit fidelity, thus leading to better results in both aspects. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique called ‚Äú**Direct Inversion**,‚Äù which rectifies inversion deviations directly within the source diffusion branch using just three lines of code, while leaving the target diffusion branch unaltered. To systematically evaluate image editing performance, we present **PIE-Bench**, an editing benchmark featuring 700 images with diverse scenes and editing types, complemented by versatile annotations. Our evaluation metrics, with a focus on editability and structure/background preservation, demonstrate the superior edit performance and inference speed of Direct Inversion across eight editing methods compared to five inversion techniques.

## üöÄ Getting Started
<span id="getting-started"></span>

### Environment Requirement üåç
<span id="environment-requirement"></span>

Since different models have different python environmnet requirements (e.g. diffusers' version), we list the environmnet in the folder "environment", detailed as follows:

- p2p_requirements.txt: for models in `run_editing_p2p.py`, `run_editing_blended_latent_diffusion.py`, `run_editing_stylediffusion.py`, and `run_editing_edit_friendly_p2p.py`
- instructdiffusion_requirements.txt: for models in `run_editing_instructdiffusion.py` and `run_editing_instructpix2pix.py`
- masactrl_requirements.txt: for models in `run_editing_masactrl.py`
- pnp_requirements.txt: for models in `run_editing_pnp.py`
- pix2pix_zero_requirements.txt: for models in `run_editing_pix2pix_zero.py`
- edict_requirements.txt: for models in `run_editing_edict.py`

For example, if you want to use the models in `run_editing_p2p.py`, you need to install the environment as follows:

```shell
conda create -n p2p python=3.9 -y
conda activate p2p
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision==0.13.1 torchaudio==0.12.1 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
pip install -r environment/p2p_requirements.txt
```

### Benchmark Download ‚¨áÔ∏è

In editing type 1-9, we equally distribut the images to artifical images and natural images *(Noted that both these two categories are real images, artifical images are paintings or other human-generated images, real images are photos)*. In both two categories, images are equally distributed to animal, human, indoor scene and outdoor scene.

For example, if you want to run DirectInversion(Ours) + Prompt-to-Prompt, you can find this method has an index `directinversion+p2p` in `run_editing_p2p.py`. Then, you can run the editing type 0 with DirectInversion(Ours) + Prompt-to-Prompt through:

```
python run_editing_p2p.py --output_path output --edit_category_list 0 --edit_method_list directinversion+p2p
```

You can also run multiple editing methods and multi editing type with:

```
python run_editing_p2p.py --edit_category_list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 --edit_method_list directinversion+p2p null-text+p2p
```

You can also specify --rerun_exist_images to choose whether rerun exist images. You can also specify --data_path and --output for image path and output path. 


**Run Any Image**

You can process your own images and editing prompts to the same format as our given benchmark to run large number of images. You can also edit the given python file to your own image. We have given out the edited python file of `run_editing_p2p.py` as `run_editing_p2p_one_image.py`. You can run one image's editing through:

```shell
python -u run_editing_p2p_one_image.py --image_path scripts/example_cake.jpg --original_prompt "a round cake with orange frosting on a wooden plate" --editing_prompt "a square cake with orange frosting on a wooden plate" --blended_word "cake cake" --output_path "directinversion+p2p.jpg" "ddim+p2p.jpg" --edit_method_list "directinversion+p2p" "ddim+p2p"
```

We also provide jupyter notebook demo `run_editing_p2p_one_image.ipynb`.

Noted that we use default parameters in our code. However, it is not optimal for all images. You may ajust them based on your inputs.

### Evaluation üìê
<span id="evaluation"></span>

You can run evaluation through:

```
python evaluation/evaluate.py --metrics "structure_distance" "psnr_unedit_part" "lpips_unedit_part" "mse_unedit_part" "ssim_unedit_part" "clip_similarity_source_image" "clip_similarity_target_image" "clip_similarity_target_image_edit_part" --result_path evaluation_result.csv --edit_category_list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 --tgt_methods 1_ddim+p2p 1_directinversion+p2p
```

You can find the choice of tgt_methods in `evaluation/evaluate.py` with the dict "all_tgt_image_folders". 

All the results of editing are avaible for download at [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hy8QTiaOZllKmwn6-vwWmHOpRP3uX-Ji?usp=sharing). You can download them and put them with file structre as follows to reproduce all the results in our paper.

```
output
  |-- ddim+p2p
    |-- annotation_images
      |-- ...
  |-- directinversion+p2p
    |-- annotation_images
      |-- ...
...    
```


If you want to evaluate the whole table's results shown in our paper, you can run:


```
python evaluation/evaluate.py --metrics "structure_distance" "psnr_unedit_part" "lpips_unedit_part" "mse_unedit_part" "ssim_unedit_part" "clip_similarity_source_image" "clip_similarity_target_image" "clip_similarity_target_image_edit_part" --result_path evaluation_result.csv --edit_category_list 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 --tgt_methods 1 --evaluate_whole_table
```

Then, all results in the table 1 will be output in evaluation_result.csv.
